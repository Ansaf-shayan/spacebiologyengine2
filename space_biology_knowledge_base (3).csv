ABSTRACT 1,Arabidopsis thaliana,"Gene expression patterns (cell wall modification, gravitropism); gravity sensing and response","Microgravity downregulates genes involved in cell wall modification and gravitropism in Arabidopsis thaliana, leading to impaired gravity sensing and response.","Microgravity exposure significantly alters gene expression patterns in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, specifically downregulating genes related to cell wall modification and gravitropism, which suggests a difficulty in sensing and responding to gravity."
ABSTRACT 2,Human,Immune system (lymphocytes),DNA repair mechanisms were overwhelmed by cosmic radiation exposure.,"A study conducted on the ISS investigated the impact of cosmic radiation on human lymphocytes, showing a dose-dependent increase in DNA double-strand breaks."
ABSTRACT 3,C. elegans,Musculoskeletal system (muscle),"Muscle atrophy occurred significantly faster in space than on Earth, with rapid degradation of key proteins for muscle fiber maintenance.",An experiment focusing on the nematode C. elegans found accelerated muscle atrophy and rapid degradation of muscle fiber maintenance proteins in space compared to Earth.
ABSTRACT 4,Salmonella typhimurium,Astronaut health / Infectious disease susceptibility,Salmonella typhimurium's virulence is enhanced in microgravity on the ISS due to the upregulation of stress response proteins.,"The bacterium Salmonella typhimurium exhibits enhanced virulence under microgravity conditions on the ISS, a phenomenon linked to the upregulation of stress response proteins, posing a significant infectious disease risk for astronauts."
ABSTRACT 5,Human,Vascular pressure regulation; Cardiovascular system; Ocular system,"Short-term spaceflight causes a cephalad fluid shift in astronauts, resulting in ocular changes like cotton wool spots and choroidal folds, primarily due to issues with vascular pressure regulation.","Short-term spaceflight induces a cephalad fluid shift in astronauts, leading to specific ocular changes, with vascular pressure regulation being the affected system."
ABSTRACT 6,Bone cells (osteoblasts and osteoclasts),Skeletal system / Bone density,The mechanical stimulation required for maintaining bone density is absent in space.,An experiment using bone cells in simulated microgravity demonstrated a shift towards bone resorption (loss) and away from bone formation.
ABSTRACT 7,*Oryza sativa* (rice),Root systems,Root systems were less developed and showed altered structural orientation compared to ground controls.,"The full life cycle of *Oryza sativa* (rice) was documented in the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) on the ISS, revealing abnormalities in root development and orientation compared to ground controls."
ABSTRACT 8,mice,"central nervous system, hippocampus",Simulated deep-space radiation leads to long-term cognitive and memory deficits in rodent models due to damage in the hippocampus.,"Exposure to simulated Mars and deep-space radiation, specifically high-energy iron ions, caused long-term cognitive and memory deficits in mice."
ABSTRACT 9,Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast),Metabolism (anaerobic fermentation),Anaerobic fermentation in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* was significantly accelerated in microgravity.,"Experiments on *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* in microgravity revealed that its anaerobic fermentation metabolism was significantly accelerated, suggesting implications for microbial controls in closed-loop life support systems."
ABSTRACT 10,tardigrades (water bears),gene expression,"Tardigrades exhibit extraordinary resilience, surviving extreme dehydration and radiation exposure with high viability, validating their use as a model for extreme biology.","Research on tardigrades demonstrated their extraordinary resilience, showing survival of extreme dehydration and radiation exposure with high viability even with altered gene expression in space, confirming their utility as a model for extreme biology."
