ABSTRACT 1,Arabidopsis thaliana,"Gene expression, cell wall modification, gravitropism","Microgravity exposure downregulates genes for cell wall modification and gravitropism in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting difficulty in sensing and responding to gravity.","Microgravity exposure significantly altered gene expression patterns in Arabidopsis thaliana, specifically downregulating genes related to cell wall modification and gravitropism, indicating an impaired ability to sense and respond to gravity."
ABSTRACT 2,Human,Immune system,DNA repair mechanisms were overwhelmed by cosmic radiation in human immune cells.,"A study conducted on the ISS investigated the effects of cosmic radiation on human immune cells (lymphocytes), revealing a dose-dependent increase in DNA double-strand breaks and highlighting the vulnerability of the human immune system to the space environment."
ABSTRACT 3,C. elegans (nematode),Musculoskeletal system (muscle),"Muscle atrophy occurred significantly faster in space than on Earth, accompanied by rapid degradation of key proteins for muscle fiber maintenance.","An experiment using the nematode C. elegans investigated muscle atrophy in space, observing accelerated degradation of muscle fibers."
ABSTRACT 4,Salmonella typhimurium,Host infectious disease susceptibility,Microgravity enhances the virulence of Salmonella typhimurium by upregulating stress response proteins.,"Salmonella typhimurium exhibits enhanced virulence under microgravity conditions on the ISS due to the upregulation of certain stress response proteins, posing a major infectious disease risk for astronauts."
ABSTRACT 5,Human (astronauts),Vascular pressure regulation; Cardiovascular system,"Short-term spaceflight induces a cephalad fluid shift in astronauts, resulting in ocular pathologies including cotton wool spots and choroidal folds.","Short-term spaceflight in astronauts leads to a cephalad fluid shift, causing ocular changes such as cotton wool spots and choroidal folds."
ABSTRACT 6,Human bone cells (osteoblasts and osteoclasts),Skeletal system,"The mechanical stimulation required for maintaining bone density is absent in space, leading to bone loss.",An experiment using human bone cells (osteoblasts and osteoclasts) in simulated microgravity demonstrated a shift towards bone resorption and away from bone formation.
ABSTRACT 7,Oryza sativa (rice),Root system,Root systems of space-grown Oryza sativa were less developed and showed altered structural orientation compared to ground controls.,"The flowering plant Oryza sativa (rice) was grown on the ISS in the Veggie system, completing its full life cycle, but demonstrated less developed root systems and altered structural orientation compared to ground controls."
ABSTRACT 8,Mice,Central nervous system (hippocampus),Simulated Mars and deep-space radiation induces long-term cognitive and memory deficits in rodent models.,Exposure of mice to simulated Mars and deep-space radiation (high-energy iron ions) led to long-term cognitive and memory deficits.
ABSTRACT 9,Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast),metabolism (anaerobic fermentation),Anaerobic fermentation in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* was significantly accelerated in microgravity.,"Experiments on *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* in microgravity demonstrated an acceleration of its anaerobic fermentation, suggesting implications for microbial control in closed-loop life support systems."
ABSTRACT 10,Tardigrades (water bears),Gene expression (molecular/genetic system),"Tardigrades survived extreme dehydration and radiation exposure with high viability, confirming their use as a model for extreme biology despite some altered gene expression in space.","Research on tardigrades in space demonstrated their extraordinary resilience, highlighting their ability to survive extreme dehydration and radiation exposure despite some altered gene expression, confirming their utility as a model for extreme biology."
